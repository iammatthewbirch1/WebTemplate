# WebTemplate
Simple template for creating websites. 

## Development
Start by cloning the folder   
Open command prompt on the file path and install the package dependencies   
	Run: `npm install`   
To begin development, and initialize browser-sync   
	Run: `gulp`

## Git Setup
First we want to create a new repo in GitHub   
Next we will remove the git link   
	Run: `git remote rm WebTemplate`   
Then we will add our new repo   
	Run: `git remote add origin https://github.com/git_username/git_repo_name.git`   
You can then check that both streams are correctly hooked up.   
	Run: `git remote -v`
